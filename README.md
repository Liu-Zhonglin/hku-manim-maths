# Animating Mathematics with Manim - An HKU SaP Project



Welcome to the official repository for the **"Animating Mathematics with Manim"** project, a student-led initiative under the University of Hong Kong's "Student as Partner" (SaP) program.

### Project Goals

Our primary goal is to make complex mathematical concepts more intuitive and engaging for students. We believe that visual learning is a powerful tool, and we use the Manim animation engine to bring abstract ideas to life.

We aim to produce:
1.  **High-Quality Mathematical Explainers:** Short, focused videos that break down challenging topics from calculus, linear algebra, and more.
2.  **Manim Engine Tutorials:** A series of guides to help other students at HKU and beyond get started with creating their own mathematical animations.

This repository stores all the Python scripts, assets, and resources used in our productions.

### Repository Structure

Our work is organized into the following directories:

* `/productions`: Contains the final, polished Python scripts for our mathematical animation videos. (Managed by the Producer)
* `/tutorials`: Contains the scripts for our Manim tutorial series, explaining how to use various features of the library. (Managed by the Tutorial-Makers)
* `/assets`: Contains shared media files like images, sound effects, or custom fonts used across multiple projects.

### Our Team

* **Liu Zhonglin(Joe)**: Team leader, Main Producer
* **Li KangCheng(Rankin)[https://github.com/pieceofvegetable]**: Manim Tutor, Tutorial Production
* **Guo Kunhan(Alex)[https://github.com/alexguo0521]**: Manim Tutor, Tutorial Production

### Getting Started

To run these scripts, you will need to have a working installation of Manim
